 ### Silver Challenge
 It is not uncommon to place instances of the `Array` type inside of a dictionary. Create a dictionary that represents a state. Your dictionary’s keys will refer to counties (to keep it short, only include three counties). Each key should map onto an array that holds five of the zip codes within that county. (You can make up the county names and zip codes.) 
 
 Finally, log only the dictionary’s zip codes. Your result should look something like the output below. Note that we are formatting the zip codes so that they do not overflow the page. Your zip codes may appear in a single line.
 
    Georgia has the following zip codes: [30306, 30307, 30308, 30309, 30310,
                                          30311, 30312, 30313, 30314, 30315,
                                          30301, 30302, 30303, 30304, 30305]

 ### Gold Challenge
 Repeat the silver challenge, but this time make sure that the formatting above matches what you print to the console. You may need to search the documentation for how to represent special characters in `String` literals (e.g., how do you represent a newline in a `String`?). You will also want to look at the documentation for the `print()` function to use a new parameter called `terminator`. This parameter defaults to printing a new line after each `String` logged to the console, but you will want to do something else.
 
 There are many ways to solve this challenge, but one way would be to print a `String` with a certain number of empty spaces (it is up to you to figure out how many!) when you print specific zip codes.
