 ### Bronze Challenge
 Create a new `String` instance called `empty` and give it an empty string: `let empty = ""`. It is useful to be able to tell if a string has any characters in it. Use the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties on `empty` to determine whether this string is truly empty. Next, consult the documentation via the Help menu item in Xcode for a cleaner way to accomplish this check.
