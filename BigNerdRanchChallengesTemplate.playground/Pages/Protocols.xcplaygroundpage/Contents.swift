 ### Silver Challenge
 The `printTable(_:)` function has a bug – it crashes if any of the data items are longer than the label of their column. Try changing Joe’s age to 1,000 to see this happen. Fix the bug. (For an easier version of this challenge, just make the function not crash. For a harder version, make sure all the rows and columns of the table are still aligned correctly.)

 ### Gold Challenge
 Create a new type, `BookCollection`, that conforms to `TabularDataSource`. Calling `printTable(_:)` on a book collection should show a table of books with columns for titles, authors, and average reviews on Amazon. (Unless all the books you use have very short titles and author names, you will need to have completed the previous challenge!)
