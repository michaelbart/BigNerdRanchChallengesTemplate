 ## Optionals
 ---
 ### Bronze Challenge
 Optionals are best used for things that can literally be nil; that is, they are useful in representing the complete absence of something. But nonexistence is not the same as zero. For example, if you are writing code to model a bank account, and the user has no balance in a given account, the value `0` is more appropriate than nil. In other words, the user does not lack an account; what they are missing is money! Take a look at the examples below and select which type would model them best.
  - The number of kids a parent has: `Int` or `Int?`
  - The name of a person’s pet: `String` or `String?`

 ### Silver Challenge
 Earlier in the chapter we told you that accessing an optional’s value when it is `nil` will result in a runtime error. Make this mistake by force-unwrapping an optional when it is `nil`. Next, examine the error and understand what the error is telling you.
