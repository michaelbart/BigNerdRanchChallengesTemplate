 ### Bronze Challenge
 In this chapter, you sorted a collection by returning a new instance of `Array` with its integers sorted from smallest to largest. You can also sort collections in place. Modify the existing example of sorting `volunteerCounts` to sort the array in place. Sort from smallest to largest.

 ### Bronze Challenge
 In this chapter, you used `sorted(by:)` to sort a collection from smallest to largest. But if you just want to sort a collection in an ascending fashion, then there is a simpler method to use. Use the documentation to find this method. Also apply this method to your solution to the previous bronze challenge.

 ### Gold Challenge
 Use what you have learned in this chapter to clean up the implementation of `reduce(_:_:)` presented above. The implementation can be shortened quite significantly: Your solution should be expressed in one line. When you are done, take a look at the sample code for the other higher-order functions and practice with them.
