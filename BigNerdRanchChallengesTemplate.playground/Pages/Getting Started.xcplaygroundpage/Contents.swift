 ### Bronze Challenge
 
 Many of the chapters in this book end with one or more challenges. The challenges are for you to work through on your own to deepen your understanding of Swift and get a little extra experience. Your first challenge is below. Before you get started, create a new playground. 
 
 You learned about the `String` type and printing to the console using `print()`. Use your new playground to create a new instance of the `String` type. Set the value of this instance to be equal to your last name. Print its value to the console.
