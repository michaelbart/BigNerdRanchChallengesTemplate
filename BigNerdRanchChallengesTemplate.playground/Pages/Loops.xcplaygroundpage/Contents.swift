 ### Silver Challenge
 Fizz Buzz is a game used to teach division. Create a version of the game that works like this: For every value in a given range, print out “FIZZ” if the current number is evenly divisible by 3. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print out “BUZZ.” If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, then print out “FIZZ BUZZ.” If the number is not evenly divisible by 3 or 5, then simply print out the number. 
 
 For example, over the range of 1 through 10, playing Fizz Buzz should yield this: “1, 2, FIZZ, 4, BUZZ, FIZZ, 7, 8, FIZZ, BUZZ.”
 
 Computers love to play Fizz Buzz. The game is perfect for loops and conditionals. Loop over the range from 0 through 100 and print “FIZZ,” “BUZZ,” or “FIZZ BUZZ” appropriately for each number in the range.
 
 For bonus points, solve Fizz Buzz with both an `if/else` conditional and a `switch` statement. When using the `switch`, make sure to match against a tuple in its various cases.
