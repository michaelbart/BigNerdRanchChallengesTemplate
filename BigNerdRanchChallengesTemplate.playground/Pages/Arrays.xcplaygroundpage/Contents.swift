 ## Arrays

 ### Bronze Challenge
 Look at the array below.
 
 `var toDoList = ["Take out garbage", "Pay bills", "Cross off finished items"]`
 
 Use the documentation to locate a `var` defined on the `Array` type that will tell you whether `toDoList` contains any elements.

 ### Silver Challenge
 Enter the array from the bronze challenge in your playground. Use a loop to reverse the order of the elements of this array. Log the results to the console. Finally, examine the documentation to see if there is a more convenient way to do this operation.

 ### Gold Challenge
 You will often work with instances of `Array` via their indices. Consult the documentation to find a method on `Array` that will locate the index of `"Fly hot air balloon to Fiji"` in your `bucketList`. Beware: This method will return an `Index?` (i.e., an optional index). Unwrap that value and use it to compute the index that is two positions later in the array. Last, use this new index to find the `String` at that position within your `bucketList`.
