 ### Bronze Challenge
 The idea of asset ownership by a `Person` is incomplete. `Person` has a way to take ownership of an asset, but no way to give up ownership of an asset. Update `Person` so that an instance can relinquish an asset. (Hint: You will probably need to update `Accountant`, too, if you want a valid net worth value.)

 ### Silver Challenge
 Create another `Person` in `main.swift`. Immediately after you give `Bob` ownership of the laptop, try giving your new `Person` ownership of the same laptop. Now both people own the laptop! Fix this bug.
