 ### Bronze Challenge
 Consider the following code that models the cities two people have visited as sets.
 
 `let myCities = Set(["Atlanta", "Chicago", "Jacksonville", "New York", "San Francisco"])`
 
 `let yourCities = Set(["Chicago", "San Francisco", "Jacksonville"])`
 
 Find a method on `Set` that returns a `Bool` indicating whether `myCities` contains all of the cities contained by `yourCities`. (Hint: This relationship would make `myCities` a superset of `yourCities`.)

 ### Silver Challenge
 In this chapter, you used methods like `union(_:)` and `intersection(_:)` to create new sets. Sometimes, however, you may not want to create new instances, but rather to modify the existing instances in place. Look through the documentation and find the appropriate methods on the `Set` type. Rework the examples in the chapter for `union(_:)` and `intersection(_:)` to use these methods.
