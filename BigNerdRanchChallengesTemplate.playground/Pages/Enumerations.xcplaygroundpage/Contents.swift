 ## Enumerations

 ### Bronze Challenge
 Add a `perimeter()` method to the `ShapeDimensions` enum. This method should compute the perimeter of a shape (the sum of the length of all its edges). Make sure you handle all the cases!

 ### Silver Challenge
 Add another case to the `ShapeDimensions` enum for a right triangle. You can ignore the orientation of the triangle. Just keep track of the lengths of its three sides. Adding a new case will cause your playground to give you an error in the `area()` method. Fix the error.
